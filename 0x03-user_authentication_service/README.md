### Abstract

This document outlines a comprehensive project focused on creating a user authentication service using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and bcrypt. The project involves building a robust authentication system that includes user registration, login, session management, password reset functionality, and secure password hashing. The project emphasizes best practices for authentication development, highlighting the importance of using established libraries and avoiding the implementation of custom authentication mechanisms.

### Key Points

* **User Authentication Service:** The project aims to create a secure and reliable user authentication service for web applications.
* **Flask Framework:** The service is built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, to handle requests and responses.
* **SQLAlchemy ORM:** SQLAlchemy is utilized to interact with the database, providing an object-relational mapping layer for efficient data management.
* **Password Hashing:** Bcrypt library is employed for secure password hashing, ensuring that passwords are not stored in plain text.
* **Session Management:** The service implements session management using cookies to track logged-in users and maintain their sessions.
* **Password Reset Functionality:** The project includes a password reset feature, allowing users to recover their accounts if they forget their passwords.
* **API Endpoints:** Multiple API endpoints are defined for user registration, login, logout, profile retrieval, and password reset.
